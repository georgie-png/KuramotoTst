# Kuramoto clustering Test
An early test for the [Sentinel Self](https://sisselmarietonn.com/project/the-sentinel-self) project, checking out some dynamics with [Kuramoto model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto_model) in 3D space with physics, clustering and a playable node. This became the backbone system for agents within the system.

## Test it Here :
